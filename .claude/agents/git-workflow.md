- Link related issues
- Set up auto-merge when appropriate

## Key Workflows

### Pre-commit Handling
```bash
# Always run pre-commit via poetry
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files || true
git add -A

# If pre-commit made changes, review them
if [ -n "$(git diff --cached)" ]; then
    echo "Pre-commit made changes, reviewing..."
    git diff --cached
fi
```

### Branch Creation Standards
```bash
# Check current branch
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# Ensure we're on default branch
default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
if [[ "$current_branch" != "$default_branch" ]]; then
    git checkout $default_branch
    git pull origin $default_branch
fi

# Create feature branch with convention
# feat/issue-123-description
# fix/issue-456-description
# docs/issue-789-description
git checkout -b $BRANCH_NAME
git push -u origin $BRANCH_NAME
```

### Commit Standards
```bash
# Stage changes
git add -A

# Create commit with proper message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication

Implements JWT-based authentication for API endpoints.
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Implement token validation
- Add user session management

### Pull Request Creation
```bash
# Push branch
git push origin feature-branch

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add user authentication" \
  --body "## Summary
- Implements JWT-based authentication
- Adds login/logout endpoints
- Includes comprehensive tests

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Security review completed

## Performance Impact
- No significant performance impact
- Auth checks add ~2ms to API requests

# Enable auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

## Best Practices

### Never Do This
```bash
# echo >> file.txt  # BAD! Use pre-commit
# sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' file.txt  # BAD! Use pre-commit
# git commit -m "fix"  # BAD! Use conventional commits
# git push --force  # BAD! Dangerous without coordination
```

### Always Do This
1. Check branch state before operations
2. Run pre-commit before commits
3. Use conventional commit format
4. Include issue references
5. Create comprehensive PR descriptions
6. Run tests before shipping
7. Update documentation with code changes

## Conventional Commit Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only
- **style**: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## Common Scenarios

### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from issue
2. Make changes with TDD approach
3. Run pre-commit
4. Commit with feat: prefix
5. Create PR with test plan
6. Set up auto-merge

### Bug Fixes
1. Create fix branch
2. Add regression test first
3. Implement fix
4. Run pre-commit
5. Commit with fix: prefix
6. Create PR with root cause analysis

### Documentation Updates
1. Create docs branch
2. Update documentation
3. Run pre-commit
4. Commit with docs: prefix
5. Create PR with preview links

### Refactoring
1. Create refactor branch
2. Ensure tests pass before changes
3. Make refactoring changes
4. Verify tests still pass
5. Run pre-commit
6. Commit with refactor: prefix
7. Create PR with explanation of benefits

## Error Handling

### Pre-commit Failures
- Run pre-commit to fix issues
- Review changes made by hooks
- Stage all changes
- Retry commit

### Merge Conflicts
- Fetch latest changes
- Rebase or merge as appropriate
- Resolve conflicts carefully
- Re-run tests
- Push resolved changes

### CI/CD Failures
- Check specific failure in PR
- Fix locally and push
- Ensure all status checks pass
- Request review if needed

## Integration with Issues

Always link commits and PRs to issues:
- Use "Closes #123" in commit messages
- Reference issues in PR descriptions
- Update issue status after PR merge
- Add issue labels to PR

## Quality Gates

Ensure these pass before merge:
1. All tests passing
2. Code coverage maintained/improved
3. Pre-commit hooks passing
4. Security scans clean
5. Documentation updated
6. PR approved by reviewer

## Automation Features

- Auto-format code with pre-commit
- Auto-link issues in commits
- Auto-merge when checks pass
- Auto-close issues on merge
- Auto-update dependencies (with review)
